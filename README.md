#The Hours: A simple time management application

This is a simple rails app that allows staff members to record how they spend their time.

#To do
- Make it so staffers can see all their timestamps but only edit the stamps from the last 24 hours
- Make it so staffers can download as CSV all their timestamps
- Add graphs to visualize their daily and overall time usage
- Add notification to remind staffers to record their timestamps at end of day if they are already not incrementally recording them
